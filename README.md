# PM Coq Code
This repository records my attempt to formalize Principia Mathematica with Coq's proving system.

Currently this repository contains two files in Coq, namely:

- PL.v
- debruijin_shallowembeding.v

And there's a "development log" `Notes.md` explaining what I'm working on throughout the days. Check this for more detail.
